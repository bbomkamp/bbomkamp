# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Hey there, I'm Brad Bomkamp!

I'm a DevOps Engineer with experience building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure. GitLab CI, AWS (EC2, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CloudFormation, RDS, S3), Artifactory, Xray, Ansible Tower, Jenkins, and Prometheus. I focus on automating processes, improving deployment workflows, and ensuring system reliability.

With a background in full-stack web design, I have a solid understanding of both development and operational needs, allowing me to integrate DevOps practices effectively across projects. Whether it's managing infrastructure on AWS, setting up artifact repositories, or handling monitoring, I'm focused on delivering practical, efficient solutions.
